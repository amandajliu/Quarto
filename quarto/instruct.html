		<h1>Instructions</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>There are 16 pieces that do not belong to either player. Each piece has a variation of four physical traits - color (light/dark), shape (round/square), size (large/small), and fill (solid/hollow).</p>
		<b></b>
		<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>The first player to put down a piece that creates a row, column, or diagonal of four pieces that share at least one trait (ex. all four of the pieces are tall). The catch is that your opponent gets to choose which piece you play!</p>
		<b></b>
		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<p>During the first turn, the first player chooses a piece for their opponent to play. During each of the following turns, a player moves the piece of their opponent's choosing on to an unoccupied circular tile on the board, then chooses one of the remaining pieces for their opponent to play. To finish your turn, click the "Next turn" button.</p>
